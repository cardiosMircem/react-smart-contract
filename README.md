# Hello world smart contract implementation

A simple example of how smart contract is called in a basic react app.

## Why it is useful

A newbie can get his hands dirty on a smart contract client for the first time with a functioning example.

## Utilization

1. clone this repo

2. `npm install`

3. `npm run start`

4. open your browser and go to localhost:3000

5. go to BSC tab

6. click 'run smart contract'

You will see 'hello world' near the button. This string is saved in the smart contract you called by clicking the button.

The smart contract is on the BSC testnet.
